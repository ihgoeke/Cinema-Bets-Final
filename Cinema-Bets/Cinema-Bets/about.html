  <h5> About... </h5>
  The way this site works is simple: it doesn't.  The plan is to use Rotten Tomatoes' Movie Appraisal value after
  a given amount of time has passed since movie's release as a value to be betted on in various ways.  For example,
  say there is a movie coming out that you think is going to suck, but all you seem to hear people saying is how good
  that same movie looks.  Each trailer you see makes it look worse and worse, but everyone keeps getting hyped! Now,
  if the movie is on Cinema Bets, you can make money off of having a more accurate movie judgment than your hapless peers.
