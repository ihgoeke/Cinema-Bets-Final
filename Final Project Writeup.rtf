	At the beginning of the class, I was not sure how far I would be able to get on this project that I was very excited to get to work on.  As the semester\'92s other classes rained Hell on me, this class always got second priority due to it not being required for my major.  So, I was not able to devote the time that it would have taken to take this as far as I initially wanted and expected to.  I\'92m glad I was able to make it to every lecture, as I learned a lot in this class.  I\'92m quite glad I stayed enrolled as even though I didn\'92t get the website complete, I have a lot more tools at my disposal when it comes to web design, and I\'92m eager to learn more.  Next semester is going to have more free time, so I am looking forward to many youtube tutorials and web design textbooks to try to take this web site to a place where I can actually get some bets going.  I was disappointed that Rotten Tomatoes requires a company application form in order to gain access to their API, but for next steps, I plan to hard code the Rotten Tomatoes scores onto old movies and at least get a simulated gambling website going with virtual cash.  }
